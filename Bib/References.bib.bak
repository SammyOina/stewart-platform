  publisher = {{ASEE} Conferences},
  abstract = {A typical educational wind tunnel need only measure the lift and drag
	forces and be able to control the angle of attack of the mounted
	model. This paper presents a simple design for the balance apparatus
	to measure lift and drag. Two load cells are used in the apparatus,
	one to measure the vertical force (lift) and one to measure the horizontal
	force (drag). This can be used for aerodynamics studies of airplane
	and airfoil models, as well as ground vehicles such as trucks and
	cars. If desired, a third load cell can be added to enable measurements
	of the pitching moment. A linear actuator is used to change the angle
	of attack of plane and airfoil models. The actuator is mounted inside
	the force balance apparatus, using a parallel four-bar linkage so
	that the angle of attack is linearly related to the actuator position.
	The linear actuator can be controlled by a computer, and the lift,
	drag, and angle of attack data recorded on the same computer. This
	design is simple and easy to fabricate, can be added to an old wind
	tunnel in need of an upgrade or replacement or included as part of
	a new wind tunnel built from scratch. Complete details of the design
	including engineering drawings are included in the paper. The design
	is also low cost compared to commercial wind tunnel balances and
	gives sufficient accuracy for educational and some research purposes.
	A counterweight is used to mechanically zero the force readout. The
	new load balance has been tested and found accurate. It has sufficient
	precision to perform a sting drag measurement as well. A quick-connect
	mechanism is used for mounting and removing models.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom,
	controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground
	abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this
	mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions
	in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed
	axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude
	of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by
	carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the
	new attitude. Variations in control arrangements are described and
	their respective design merits considered. Other possible uses for
	this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production.},
