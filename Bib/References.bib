  booktitle = {2010 Annual Conference \& Exposition Proceedings},
  pages = {15.594.1--15.594.10},
  publisher = {{ASEE} Conferences},
  abstract = {A typical educational wind tunnel need only measure the lift and drag
	forces and be able to control the angle of attack of the mounted
	model. This paper presents a simple design for the balance apparatus
	to measure lift and drag. Two load cells are used in the apparatus,
	one to measure the vertical force (lift) and one to measure the horizontal
	force (drag). This can be used for aerodynamics studies of airplane
	and airfoil models, as well as ground vehicles such as trucks and
	cars. If desired, a third load cell can be added to enable measurements
	of the pitching moment. A linear actuator is used to change the angle
	of attack of plane and airfoil models. The actuator is mounted inside
	the force balance apparatus, using a parallel four-bar linkage so
	that the angle of attack is linearly related to the actuator position.
	The linear actuator can be controlled by a computer, and the lift,
	drag, and angle of attack data recorded on the same computer. This
	design is simple and easy to fabricate, can be added to an old wind
	tunnel in need of an upgrade or replacement or included as part of
	a new wind tunnel built from scratch. Complete details of the design
	including engineering drawings are included in the paper. The design
	is also low cost compared to commercial wind tunnel balances and
	gives sufficient accuracy for educational and some research purposes.
	A counterweight is used to mechanically zero the force readout. The
	new load balance has been tested and found accurate. It has sufficient
	precision to perform a sting drag measurement as well. A quick-connect
	mechanism is used for mounting and removing models.},

	for performance improvements, are investigated. Essentially and in
	general terms there are two approaches to modelling; black box modelling
	and detailed dynamic modelling. This work addresses both modelling
	approaches. These models are then used for hydrogen fuel cell (FC)
	controller development for improved system performance. A fuzzy-PID
	hybrid controller has been designed and tested and the results indicate
	that the fuzzy-PID hybrid control strategy can improve the system’s
