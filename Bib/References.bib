	abstract = {In this paper, fuel cell system modelling alongside controller development for performance improvements, are investigated. Essentially and in general terms there are two approaches to modelling; black box modelling and detailed dynamic modelling. This work addresses both modelling approaches. These models are then used for hydrogen fuel cell (FC) controller development for improved system performance. A fuzzy-PID hybrid controller has been designed and tested and the results indicate that the fuzzy-PID hybrid control strategy can improve the system’s performance significantly.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom, controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude.
            Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered.
            Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production.},

	title = {Force Balance Design For Educational Wind Tunnels},
	url = {http://peer.asee.org/15891},
	doi = {10.18260/1-2--15891},
	abstract = {A typical educational wind tunnel need only measure the lift and drag forces and be able to control the angle of attack of the mounted model. This paper presents a simple design for the balance apparatus to measure lift and drag. Two load cells are used in the apparatus, one to measure the vertical force (lift) and one to measure the horizontal force (drag). This can be used for aerodynamics studies of airplane and airfoil models, as well as ground vehicles such as trucks and cars. If desired, a third load cell can be added to enable measurements of the pitching moment. A linear actuator is used to change the angle of attack of plane and airfoil models. The actuator is mounted inside the force balance apparatus, using a parallel four-bar linkage so that the angle of attack is linearly related to the actuator position. The linear actuator can be controlled by a computer, and the lift, drag, and angle of attack data recorded on the same computer. This design is simple and easy to fabricate, can be added to an old wind tunnel in need of an upgrade or replacement or included as part of a new wind tunnel built from scratch. Complete details of the design including engineering drawings are included in the paper. The design is also low cost compared to commercial wind tunnel balances and gives sufficient accuracy for educational and some research purposes. A counterweight is used to mechanically zero the force readout. The new load balance has been tested and found accurate. It has sufficient precision to perform a sting drag measurement as well. A quick-connect mechanism is used for mounting and removing models.},
