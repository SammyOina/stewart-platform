	abstract = {In this paper, fuel cell system modelling alongside controller development for performance improvements, are investigated. Essentially and in general terms there are two approaches to modelling; black box modelling and detailed dynamic modelling. This work addresses both modelling approaches. These models are then used for hydrogen fuel cell (FC) controller development for improved system performance. A fuzzy-PID hybrid controller has been designed and tested and the results indicate that the fuzzy-PID hybrid control strategy can improve the system’s performance significantly.},
