\section{Wind Tunnel}
A wind tunnel is a large tube with air moving inside. This movement of air is usually done by powerful fans.

The first wind tunnel was built by Francis Wenham in 1871. However, it was the Wright Brothers who were the first to show the value of the wind tunnel in aerodynamic design with their 1902 wind tunnel. The Wright Brothers’ wind tunnel was largely made of wood, with a glass window on the top to look down through and see the force balance, from which the
lift and drag forces could be read. The wind tunnel was powered by a fan driven off a natural gas fueled engine. Their tunnel was square of 16" by 16"(about 407mm by 407mm), and 6 foot long (about 1829mm), with a maximum test speed of 35 mph (about 56 km/h)\cite{morris_force_2010}.


Later in the early 20th century in Europe, the main users of wind tunnels were Gustave Eiffel in France and Ludwig Prandtl in Germany. Prandtl built the first closed circuit wind tunnel in 1908. Closed circuit wind tunnels are characterized by the recirculation of the airflow with very minimal exchange with the exterior. Open circuit wind tunnels on the other hand, have an airflow that follows a straight path and flows to the contracted zone where the test section is located and then passes through a diffuser, a fan section and an exhaust.

By the 1940’s supersonic wind tunnels were in use. In 1972, a cryogenic wind tunnel was built at NASA Langley by injecting liquid nitrogen into the wind tunnel to cool the gas. This lowered the viscosity and increased the Reynolds number, and this tunnel had the capability to match Reynolds and Mach numbers simultaneously up to Mach 1.2
\cite{fernandes_design_nodate}.

Today the largest wind tunnel in the world is the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at NASA's Ames Research Center, which has a test section of cross-section 80 ft by 100 ft (24 m x 31 m). The types of instruments in common use in wind tunnels include boundary layer rakes, tufts, pitot tubes, pressure sensitive paint, smoke, and static pressure taps \cite{morris_force_2010}.

NASA uses wind tunnels to test scale models of aircraft and spacecraft. Wind tunnels help NASA to test ideas of making airplanes better and safer. They are also used to help engineers in designing spacecraft that will work in other planets such as mars - the wind tunnel can be used to simulate objects in an atmosphere that's thinner than ours e.g. an atmosphere that's exactly like the Martian atmosphere. NASA has wind tunnels of different types and sizes. Some are low-speed wind tunnels, others are hypersonic i.e. they are made to carry out tests at 4,000 mph (6437 kph) \cite{NASA}.

\section{Stewart Platform}
Parallel link manipulators have become an important area of research due to their: precision, rigidity and high-load-to-weight ratio. These manipulators find practical applications in flight simulators, precise machining and applications that require disturbance isolation \cite{iqbal_dynamic_2008}. The Stewart platform is an example of a parallel manipulator.

A Stewart platform is a parallel manipulator that provides six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) i.e. roll, pitch, yaw, surge, sway and heave, and can be controlled in all these freedoms simultaneously. The platform consists six variable-length electro-mechanical actuators connecting a top plate to a base plate with spherical joints.

The platform is able to move in three angular directions and in three linear directions, singly or in any combination \cite{stewart1965platform}. Angular and translational motion of the top plate with
respect to the base plate is achieved by reducing or extending the actuator lengths. For the top plate to follow the desired trajectory with high frequency, there has to be proper coordination of the actuator lengths \cite{iqbal_dynamic_2008}.

Each leg of the mechanism is connected to the ground by a two-axis joint where: One of these axes is
normal to the leg and is provided with a means for control whereas, the other axis is normal to the first and is not provided with a means for control.
Each leg also has controllable means for extending its length. These control means include \cite{stewart1965platform}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use of hydraulic jacks.
\item Screw jacks - This gives give the advantage of
a longer stroke for a given size.
\item Rotary actuator - a hydraulic rotary actuator or an electric motor. Whereas this would reduce the number of foundation fixings, the remaining jack would still be subjected to a greater bending moment.
\item Levers - this increases the extending leg amplitude by using an articulated leg.
\item Linear co-ordinate control - this arrangement provides rigidity due to the true triangulation of
the whole system. There will be no bending moments in any of the members apart from the possibility of those due to strut eccentric loading. 
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Figures/Fig11}
	\caption[Linear co-ordinate control]{Linear co-ordinate control \cite{stewart1965platform}}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}

Stewart platforms that use screw jacks driven by electric motors as leg actuators have the advantage of being light and easy to control. Velocity and position control for these platforms can be done using shaft encoders and tachometers. A ball screw is used to minimize friction in a screw drive and backlash in the ball screw can be eliminated by use of double nuts preloaded with spring washers \cite{fichter1986stewart}.

The Stewart platform has drawn the interest of many researchers who have focused on solving kinematics, dynamics and control of the mechanism. Both inverse kinematic and forward kinematic methods for the Stewart platform are presented in literature
\cite{csumnu2017simulation}.

In order to control the platform in the required direction, a program involving linear or angular accelerations or a combination of both is necessary so that signals can be given to the various legs in accordance with the input requirements. The six inputs to the Stewart platform in terms of torque are calculated by the controller and the outputs of the Stewart platform are the upper plate's angular and translational positions sensed by highly precise sensors or estimated by the motor's encoders \cite{iqbal_dynamic_2008}.

Further, as concerns the control aspect, in recent years many researchers have worked on robust controllers for the Stewart platform. Some of these works include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A Lyapunov based approach for designing robust PD controller was proposed in presence of uncertainties 
\cite{kang1996robust}.
\item The model based sliding mode control with perturbation 
\cite{kang1996robust}.
\item Robust tracking control design in the presence of time varying
uncertainties 
\cite{kim1998high}.
\item Tracking errors drive to zero asymptotically with help of sliding mode
controller design 
\cite{huang2004sliding}.
\item A simple way to calculate control law using sliding-mode technique 
\cite{iqbal2006direct}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Force Balances}
For wind tunnel applications, the wind axes is used as the reference frame. Where, X axis points to the accelerated air; Z axis points downward and; Y axis points to the right in the direction of the wind. In the reference frame above, lift is in the negative z-direction, drag in the negative x-direction and, side force in the negative y-direction \cite{bueno2018design}.

Moment components on the x,y,z axes are rolling moment, pitching moment and yawing moment respectively. A three-component force balance can be considered to measure the lift, drag and pitch (angle of attack).

Force balances can be external or internal. In external force balances the test section lies outside of the wind tunnel test section, whereas in internal force balances the balance is inside the model itself connecting the model to the support structure.
\subsection{External Force Balances}
Several different types of external force balances are available for wind tunnel use
\cite{morris_force_2010}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wire
\item Platform
\item Yoke
\item Pyramidal
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{Figures/Fig6}
	\caption[External Force balances]{Typical configurations for external force balances \cite{ferreira2015design}}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}
In the wire balance, the model under testing is suspended by wires each connected to an extensometer (a sensor that produces an electrical output when submitted to a load and deforms). The shortcoming of the wire balance is the large tare drag caused by the wires which is difficult to quantify. They are also not robust nor versatile enough compared with the other alternatives \cite{ferreira2015design}. 

The platform balance is relatively easy to construct, assemble and instrument. However, for this balance, forces and torques are coupled and the balance resolving centre does not coincide with the centre of the tunnel.
 
In the yoke balance configuration, forces and torques are coupled and the balance resolving centre coincides with the centre of the tunnel. This configuration, however, presents some structural deflections due to the large span of the measuring and support arms.

The pyramidal balance configuration is a further improvement of the yoke balance in order to overcome the shortcomings of the other balances. It is capable of measuring six components of forces and
torques separately and without coupling,provided that the balance is well assembled and calibrated.

It is possible to merge some of the force balance concepts to come up with an innovative, easy-to-manufacture and cost-effective external force balance. One such solution can be the use of a Stewart platform as a force balance. The Stewart platform offers another advantage - dynamic positioning of the model in the test section.
The platform bars are subjected to axial forces only and can have strain-gauges coupled to each one as Wheatstone briges. Forces and torques are themn obtained based on the axial displacements obtained by the strain gauges\cite{fernandes_design_nodate}.
\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages}\\
\hline
Wire & Relatively simple construction & large tare drag\\
 & & Less Versatile and robust\\
 \hline
Platform & Easy consruction and instrumentation & Force and torques coupled\\
 & & Center alignment difficulties\\
 \hline
 Yoke & Overcomes center alignment problems & Structural deflections\\
 \hline
 Pyramidal & Overcomes shortcoming of other balances & \\
 & Measures 6 components of forces and torques & \\
 \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Internal Force Balances}
The different kinds of internal balances can be made based on \cite{ferreira2015design}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The type of transducer i.e. strain gauge or piezoelectric balance.
\item Shape i.e. box balance and sting balance
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/Fig7}
	\caption[Internal force balances]{Typical configurations for internal force balances. \textit{Left to right:} Box balance and sting balance \cite{ferreira2015design}.}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}
The box balance presents a cubic shape and can either be made of a solid piece of material or from assembled parts. In this configuration, the loads are transferred from the top to the bottom. The sting balance presents a cylindrical shape and the loads are transferred from one end to the other in the longitudinal direction. It can be used to measure forces or torques.

The advantage of internal force balances is that they minimize the interference caused by the supporting bars in the flow.
\section{Sensors}
\subsection{Load Sensors}
Several methods can be used to measure forces and torques in a force balance. These methods can be generally grouped into two\cite{ferreira2015design}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hydraulic measuring techniques.
\item Electric measurement techniques.
\end{enumerate}
Electric measurement techniques are preferred for Force balance applications. One such electric measurement device is the strain gauge. A strain gauge is an electromechanical device whose electrical resistance changes linearly with the strain in the component.

Metal foil strain gauges are widely used. This type of strain gauges provide more precise strain values than wire strain gauges. However, since the relative changes on electric resistance of the strain gauge are so small, it is necessary to develop an effective method of measuring them because each strain gauge would require extremely accurate signal measurements. The solution is to have a set of strain gauges coupled in order to minimize the required accuracy, forming a force transducer i.e. the \textit{Wheatstone bridge}.
\begin{center}

		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Figures/Fig9}
		\caption[Wheatstone Bridge Circuit]{Wheatstone Bridge Circuit \cite{ferreira2015design}}
		\end{figure}
\end{center}
Load cells can also be used to measure the drag and lift forces\cite{ferreira2015design}.
\subsection{Attitude Sensor}
It is important to define the desired aerodynamic angles and to guarantee that they are measured accurately in relation to the air stream. One such angle is the angle of attack (\textalpha) shown in Figure 2.4. For this reason, specific devices that provide the attitude measurement should be implemented in order to improve the precision of the results.

Angle of attack (\textalpha)- angle measured between the longitudinal axis of the model and the direction of the flow on a vertical (Figure 2.4)

\end{center}
\section{State of the Art}
Force balance design for educational wind tunnels is an area of great interest. This is especially important
for aerodynamics studies of airplane and airfoil models, as well as ground vehicles such as trucks
and cars \cite{morris_force_2010}.

Force balances can be used in conjunction with a linear actuator where the
actuator is mounted inside the force balance apparatus, using a parallel four-bar linkage so that
the angle of attack is linearly related to the actuator position. Alternatively, manipulators such as the Stewart platform can serve as force balances. This section presents some of the work that has been done in this area.
\subsection{Bradley University}
The Mechanical Engineering department has a force balance installed in the test-section of a subsonic wind tunnel. The force balance comprises of two load cells to measure lift and drag forces. A linear actuator is used in conjunction with the force balance to change the angle of attack of models during testing.
\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Figures/force}
	\caption[Force balance installed]{Force balance installed in the wind tunnel \cite{morris_force_2010}}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}
There is a possibility of adding a third load cell to this configuration to enable measurement of the pitching moment. The force balance offers good results with lift and drag coefficients not changing by more than 10 percent with varying wind tunnel velocity in the range of Reynolds
numbers where the coefficients should be fairly constant \cite{morris_force_2010}.

The overall cost of coming up with this force balance is given as 1000 dollars which is significantly cheaper than the commercially available force balances. A two-component force balance goes for a minimum of 9385 dollars.
%\subsection{Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)}
%IMU’s are sensors that combine an accelerometer, a gyroscope and, in other cases, a magnetometer.
%They're used widely due to their small size and low cost. The gyroscope measures the
%sensor’s angular velocity and the accelerometer is used to measure the external force acting on the
%sensor which is not only due to its acceleration but also to the gravity. The gyroscope measurements
%can provide the change in pitch, roll and yaw by integrating the values of angular velocities along the
%three axis, but to calculate absolute values of these angles, reference data is needed. This data can be
%obtained from the accelerometer or the magnetometer. It is possible to obtain pitch and roll angles from
%the accelerometer, putting  gravitational acceleration in consideration. However, yaw angle cannot
%be obtained directly from the results of the accelerometer as it is in the same direction as the gravity.
%For calculating yaw, the data from the magnetometer as reference and then integrates the gyroscope
%information \cite{ferreira2015design}.

\subsection{East Africa School of Aviation (EASA)}
The EASA Aerodynamics lab has a subsonic wind tunnel 300mm (AF1300) and a flight demonstration wind tunnel(AF41) supplied by TECQUIPMENT. The Subsonic wind tunnel is equipped with a three component force balance, smoke generator, multi-tube manometer and a range of aerofoil drag, boundary layer low and high wing models. The Flight demonstration wind tunnel has a data acquisition module for classroom demonstrations and investigations into the behavior of fixed-wing aircraft and wing-performanceduring take-off, flight and landing \cite{TEC}.

\subsection{Tecnico Lisboa}
In 2018, Joao Fernandes of Tecnico Lisboa developed a force balance system to
be used with the aerospace engineering laboratory wind tunnel. The project was to
design a force balance measuring the six components. A Stewart platform was used as the
force and measurement system which was made possible through instrumentation of the platform legs.
For sensing, strain gauges were used and connected in a Wheatstone bridge configuration.
The system was able to measure all the six components of aerodynamic properties\cite{ferreira2015design}.

Further developments were made two years later to this design which are enumerated below \cite{ferreira2015design}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The use of a half bridge configuration of strain gauge for the measurement system.
\item Use of an Arduino DAQ system for temperature and humidity monitoring to help in
compensation of switching to a half bridge configuration for the strain gauges.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Stewart Platform at JKUAT}
Six-DOF Stewart platforms have been designed and fabricated by students in the Mechatronic Engineering department as part of their final year projects. The Stewart platforms by the first two groups of students were for different applications and the one from FYP 17 was to be used as a force balance for Wind tunnel testing. 
\section{Summary of Gaps}
Whereas the Force balance by the Mechanical Engineering department in Bradley University is relatively simple to construct, it still poses a challenge in terms of cost. Cost can be minimized based on load cell and actuator selection but this does not guarantee that the level of accuracy will not be compromised. Also, only two or three force components can be obtained.

Institutions such as EASA have procured their force balances. This may not be a cost-effective solution.

With so much research in the area of Stewart platform, there remains still more work to be done in the areas of control, dynamics, and singular positions. A 6 DOF Stewart platform with force measurement for a low-speed wind tunnel has been done as final year project in JKUAT under the department of Mechatronic Engineering (FYP 17). Whereas the former team was able to successfully design and assemble the platform, as well as the actuation circuitry, there still remains work to do in the following areas \cite{caleb}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Development of a Human-Machine-Interface for Stewart platform control.
\item Data acquisition from sensors.
\item Implementation of servo circuit control.
\item Calibration of the measurement system to be in-line with NASA airfoils.
\end{enumerate}
