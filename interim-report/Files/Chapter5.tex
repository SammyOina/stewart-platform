\chapter{Conclusion}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A six-DOF Stewart platform has been designed. This platform can achieve 3 linear and 3 angular movements. It has a high quality index i.e. 0.86 and is therefore mechanically feasible.
\item From Finite Element Analysis, the six legs of the Stewart platform experience significant strains which can be used to obtain force measurements during model testings in Wind Tunnel experiments.
\end{enumerate}
