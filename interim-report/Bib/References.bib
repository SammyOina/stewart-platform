  abstract = {A typical educational wind tunnel need only measure the lift and drag
	forces and be able to control the angle of attack of the mounted
	model. This paper presents a simple design for the balance apparatus
	to measure lift and drag. Two load cells are used in the apparatus,
	one to measure the vertical force (lift) and one to measure the horizontal
	force (drag). This can be used for aerodynamics studies of airplane
	and airfoil models, as well as ground vehicles such as trucks and
	cars. If desired, a third load cell can be added to enable measurements
	of the pitching moment. A linear actuator is used to change the angle
	of attack of plane and airfoil models. The actuator is mounted inside
	the force balance apparatus, using a parallel four-bar linkage so
	that the angle of attack is linearly related to the actuator position.
	The linear actuator can be controlled by a computer, and the lift,
	drag, and angle of attack data recorded on the same computer. This
	design is simple and easy to fabricate, can be added to an old wind
	tunnel in need of an upgrade or replacement or included as part of
	a new wind tunnel built from scratch. Complete details of the design
	including engineering drawings are included in the paper. The design
	is also low cost compared to commercial wind tunnel balances and
	gives sufficient accuracy for educational and some research purposes.
	A counterweight is used to mechanically zero the force readout. The
	new load balance has been tested and found accurate. It has sufficient
	precision to perform a sting drag measurement as well. A quick-connect
	mechanism is used for mounting and removing models.},

It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude.
            Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered.
            Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production.},

Using inverse kinematic method velocity and acceleration equations are derived. Lagrange and Newton-Euler equations are used to carry out dynamic analysis. Especially, in dynamic analysis, the lower part of leg inertia is taken into account. The required forces for the each actuator are calculated using {MATLAB} according to planned trajectories of the moving platform. Dynamic simulation of the system is presented both with and without inertial effect of the lower part of leg. Results of the dynamic simulation show that the effect of the lower part inertia of leg is important to obtain more accurate result. {PID} control of Stewart platform is performed using {MATLAB}/Simulink. Transfer function of the linear motor is derived and block diagram is obtained in Simulink. Finally, case studies are performed to verify the developed control system.},

The models found in the existing literature are most of the time only valid for static loads with symmetric configurations, as reflected by the presumed assumption on Moments of Inertia ({MOI}) being static and symmetric. Such assumption precludes a wide range of systems having asymmetric or moving payloads e.g. stabilized platforms used to stabilize satellite antenna trackers or surgical tables etc. In this paper the actual {MOI} of the Stabilizing Stewart platform with moving payload are computed and used to parameterize the extended nonlinear model. This model is subsequently used for designing sliding mode controller. The control performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with computer simulations. These simulations demonstrate better stability properties and performance of the proposed dynamic model with much lower uncertainty bounds, as compared to that of the controller designed on the prevalent nonlinear model.},

	abstract = {This document contains a final year Engineering Thesis in the design and construction of a set of sensors capable of detecting obstacles at a distance. The device is intended for use with small air and ground vehicles for obstacle detection and tracking. The device has varying applications depending on the sensor configuration, and can function as either a proximity detector, or as a speed and position tracker. The hardware is designed to be inexpensive, small and lightweight. This project involved the design and construction of a sensor simulator, a sensor array pattern, electronics to power and operate transmitters and receivers, and microcontroller software. The key features of the system are its small size, low weight, low power requirements and its ability to employ a synthetic aperture technique known as Doppler beam-sharpening to refine its field of view. This is believed to be the first application of Doppler beam-sharpening in a collision avoidance sensor application.},
