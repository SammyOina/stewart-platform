\section{Expected Outcomes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A functional hydrogen stack will be developed and tested
\item The controller for the hydrogen fuel cell will be developed and tested from a selection of controllers that were modelled and simulated.
\item The controller supporting circuitry will be developed with a custom printed circuit board.
\item Hydrogen fuel cell system performance will be optimized using the controller.
\end{enumerate}
