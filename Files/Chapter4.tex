\section{Expected Outcomes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A fuctional stewart platform with six degrees of freedom postioning of a model within a wind tunnel.
\item A functional force sensor for measuring the aerodynamic load applied on a model.
\item Obtain the aerodynamic coefficients from a test model as measured using the stewart platform load balance.
\item Working electronic circuits used to obtain sensor measurements and relay the readings.
\item A program used to obtain data, apply inputs to the stewart platform and process the data gathered.
