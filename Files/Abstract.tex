\paragraph{}Obtaining and simulating the aerodynamic performance of items in a windtunnel  is a signifacent and important part of development of vehicles, aircraft and other machines that require aerodynamic performance evaluation. As a result due to complex maneuvers that may be required to be simulated there is a need for a dynamic positioning in the wind tunnel especially for aircraft. As a result the proposal for a stewart platform to replicate complex maneuvers during wind tunnel tests as well as position the model to obtain the required data.
\paragraph{}
This project will look into the modelling, simulation and development of a stewart plaform based force balance for a small low speed wind tunnel. The project will utlize matlab/ simulink for modelling and simulation as well as autodesk inventor for the mechanical design. A robust control system will also be developed for the stewart platform. Finnally  the project will be developed and tested in a wind tunnel to evaluate the performance of the platform. The force balance and platform should be able position the test item and measure forces as well as calculate the aerodynamic coeficients using a beespoke computer program
