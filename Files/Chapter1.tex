\paragraph{}Additive manufacturing offers the ability to produce intricate products and parts with lower development costs, shorter lead times, less energy consumed during manufacturing as well as less material waste. This method can be used to manufacture delicate components such as the bipolar plates with elimination of the risks involved such as breakage of brittle Graphene material during production.     
\paragraph{}Precise control of reactant flow and pressure, stack temperature, and membrane humidity will increase the fuel cellâ€™s robustness as well as efficiency.
\paragraph{}The goal of this research is to develop physic-based dynamic models of fuel cell systems and fuel processor systems and then apply multivariable control techniques to study their behavior. The analysis will give insight into the control design limitations and provide guidelines for the necessary controller structure and system re-design.
