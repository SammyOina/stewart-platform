\section{Conclusion}
The current Stewart platform configuration was modified to allow for six degrees of freedom which includes three translations and three rotations.
From Finite Element Analysis, the six legs of the Stewart platform experience significant strains which can be used to obtain force measurements during model testing in wind tunnel experiments.
The electronic circuit to obtain flow velocity measurements and load measurements was also demonstrated. This also included the sensor selection and placement in the wind tunnel. 
The Human machine interactive interface was also developed and tested. 
The force balance was tested utilizing a real aerofoil model and the system was shown to be working as per specifications.
